In-browser integration of Nuxeo Platform and [ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/).

## Build and Install

mvn clean install
```

## Support

**These features are sand-boxed and not yet part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
